This program was my first attempt at creating a basic learning program, using storage matricies.

The program starts by playing randomly and keeps track of what decision wins more (hit or stand) in a given hand. 
After a certain amount of hands determined by the programmer, the program will then stick to the decision that performed best,
however if that decision starts performing worse than the opposite decision, then it will switch to that opposite decision.
